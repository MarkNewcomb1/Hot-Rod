	  Welcome! Here you'll find a database of information that'll help you get the most out of your Hot Rod Deluxe. After years of searching the internet I was dissapointed that there was no real source of information on this ampâ€”yet it remains one of the most popular in the world. For a long time building a Hot Rod Deluxe website was one of the things I wanted to do, and felt needed to be done. Listening to techs, experimenting with electronics, and talking with other owners inspired me to collect a large source of mods, tips, tricks, fixes, and frequently asked questions to help you on your way to finding *your* tone.
