	<h2 class="question">Oh wow, is this Justin Holton, bringing back the content that was on the old Unofficial Fender Hot Rod Deluxe User's Guide?</h2>
	    <div class="answer">
	        <p>No. His site used to be on http://studentweb.eku.edu/justin_holton (link does not work), and then he put it up on another address, http://www.justinholton.com (also doesn't work). He seems to have abandoned this information, or at least in terms of keeping the content up on the web.</p>

	      <h2 class="question">Umm...so who are you?</h2>
	      <div class="answer">
	        <p>Mark Newcomb, Colorado-based web developer. Also guitar player and classically-trained pianist. I have had experience as a recording engineer and music teacher as well.</p>

	      <h2 class="question">So I take it you have a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe yourself?</h2>
	      <div class="answer">
	        <div class="content50">
		        <p>Yup. Here it is:</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>
  <p>When the More Drive is <em>not</em> selected the J111 JFETs react no differently than two very large resistances. When the More Drive is selected a DC voltage is sent to the gate of both JFETs. This causes the <em>drain</em> and <em>source</em> to act like a closed switch, and the J111s turn into a dead short. As a result they jumper R23 and R24, turning the previous 100K&ohm; of resistance into zero ohms. Now the negative plate of the cathode caps are at ground potential, which is where they're supposed to be. As a result, the gain of both stages is practically doubled and V2A & V2B (a preamp tube) are pushed into distortion. The increase in distortion is <em>tube generated</em>, and is in no way solid state. Solid state components got their bad rap from how they distort when used for amplification. The JFETs used by the More Drive do not amplify, and are nothing more than a
switch. They color the sound no more than a resistor, or a piece of wire would. If for whatever
reason you wanted a permanent More Drive sound, just take two pieces of wire and jumper out
both 100K&ohm; resistors. So despite what some people assume, the More Drive <em>is</em> all tube.</p>
<p>A JFET "Shunt Switch" is used because it's switch element is extremely quiet and produces no
modulation or any other unwanted effects. When cathodes are bypassed we're dealing with much
more gain. The more drive significantly raises the noise floor of the amp. This means more hiss,
buzz, and mechanical noise will be amplified through the speaker. A relay would have been too
noisy since it's mechanical—the relay's pole will bounce when it slams into the contact; resulting
in a clearly audible noise. You can sometimes hear this when switching channels at low volumes.
The JFETs themselves also cost less than a quarter, while the relays are at least several dollars
each.</p>

    <h2 class="question">There's something I see in one of these articles that's wrong/inaccurate! Fix it!</h2>
	      <div class="answer">
	        <p>No. I'm not getting into that. How would I know that your information is correct, and Justin Holton's wasn't? I don't have the electrical engineering background to make that kind of judgement call, and I have absolutely <em>no desire</em> to be the referee. Use the information on this website at your own risk. Or feel free to dismiss this whole thing and click the back button, I don't care. This is strictly a "pet project" of mine that I've built and am keeping up on the web for fellow Hot Rod Deluxe enthusiasts.</p>

      	 <h2 class="question">Any way to contact you?</h2>
	      <div class="answer">
	        <p class="bottom-space">The styling of the Hot Rod Deluxe/Deville, as well as '96-Present Blues/Pro Junior, is based on a
short-lived tweed cabinet/black tolex combination that was used in the mid-60s. I'm not sure if
any vintage Deluxes ever looked like the modern Hot Rods. Before '60 all Deluxes were tweed.
From '61-'62 Fender switched to "blonde" coverings. Then from '63 to around '68 Fender went
blackface, before setting into the silverface style for most of the 70s. Below are pictures of a
modern Hot Rod Deluxe compared to a rare 1964 Champ with the original styling. A new Pro
Junior almost looks totally identical to this Champ.</p>

   <h2 class="question">Hey, I'm a web developer/designer and there's some weird styling you have going on!</h2>

	        <div class="clear"></div>
	        <p class="top-space">If you have an older amp (usually pre-MIM) the easiest way to determine is to look at the chart
below. Inside the cabinet is a little sticker (pictured above), usually to the right of the speaker. It
should say "quality assurance" on it, and have someone's handwritten initials. Look for a two
letter code on the bottom line. The first letter symbolizes the year it was made, the second letter
the month. My amp says "LA," so it was made in January of 2001. If it says "JF", then your amp
was made in June of 1999. etc..</p>
<h5 class="center-text">First Letter</h5>
<p class="center-text">G = 96 H = 97 I = 98 J = 99 K = 00 L = 01 M = 02</p>
<h5 class="center-text">Second Letter</h5>
<p class="center-text">A = JAN B = FEB C = MAR D = APR E = MAY F = JUNE G = JULY H = AUG I = SEPT J = OCT K = NOV L = DEC</p>
<figure class="content100 top-space"><img src="img/back-of-amp-with-quality-assurance-sticker.jpg" alt="back of amp with quality assurance sticker"><figcaption>Quality Assurance stickers were used in
Pre-MIM Hot Rods, and allowed users to

amp was manufactured.</figcaption></figure>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="top-space">Fender removed the Quality Assurance tags around the time production was moved to the
Mexican factory. When asked about the removal of these tags, a Fender employee said:</p>
<p>"The QA tags also no longer contain Date codes. That used to be a Safety agency requirement,
but we have moved out of the dark ages and actually track by computer and other methods now."
- Gina D.</p>
<p>Fender now uses the serial number on the back panel to date their amps. Unfortunately the serial
# has "no meaning," and access to the database that deciphers the numbers "isn't available to the
public."</p>
<p>Also, the earliest Hot Rod Deluxes were made in 1996, and had a "50th Anniversary" logo on the
back. Since this amp is arguable the most popular in the world, I'd hold on to the "50th" amps as
they may become collectable.</p>

	      <div class="answer">
	        <figure class="content100"><img src="img/v3-v2-v1.jpg" alt="v3 v2 v1"></figure>
	        <div class="clear"></div>
	        <p class="top-space">V1 is the first preamp tube, and is the most tonally important as it establishes the basic sound of
our amp—every subsequent gain stage is simply making a copy of the first gain stage. Part of V2
is used exclusively by the Drive channel, so if you're battling the Drive channel's demons you
may try using a lower gain tube in this slot. Many feel this helps smooth out the Drive channel,
and gives an overall more "bluesy" sound. V3 is the <em>phase inverter</em>, which makes sure the
powertubes are running 180 degrees out of phase. Using a lower gain tube here may help tighten
things up, and some believe it gives the Hot Rod a more vintage-like feel.</p>
<p>It's been asked if V2 affects the clean channel—the answer is YES. Most people don't realize that
the 12AX7 triode and its family (12AT7, 12AY7, etc) are actually two separate tubes inside one
enclosure. For this reason the 12AX7 family are known as <em>dual-triodes</em>. These "separate" innertriodes
are differentiated on schematics by the suffixes A and B, but collectively are inside the
same tube. For a better understanding take a closer look at your preamp tubes. At the right angle
you'll be able to see two identical triodes mounted side by side on spacers. Now that we know
where the 'A' and 'B' came from, lets map out the Hot Rod Deluxe/Deville's preamp so we can
better understand how our tone is shaped.</p>
<figure class="content100 top-space"><img src="img/gain-stage-map.jpg" alt="gain stage map"></figure>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="top-space">The first gain stage is called V1A, and it amplifies an unaltered version of our guitar's signal.
Immediately afterwards are the volume and drive controls (the drive is called "gain" on the
graphic). As you may know, the volume is only used by the clean channel, and the drive control
is only used by drive channels; but in reality the drive control is not any different than the volume
control. The Drive simply pushes V1B and V2A into distortion, while the volume control does
not. When we turn the Drive to 7, the preamp tubes are seeing the same amount of signal as they
would with the Volume set to 7. So we can play at a reasonable volume, the Master volume
grounds off much of the excess gain later in the circuit.</p>
<p>Our signal is then reamplified by V1B, to make up for any <em>insertion loss</em> (or signal loss) caused
by the volume and drive controls. The next few steps are pretty straight-forward. The "tone
stack," which you probably correctly guessed were the tone controls (Treble, Middle, & Bass)
follow. Afterward V2A compensates for the insertion loss caused by the tone stack. What
happens next will be dictated by which channel we're using.</p>
<p>If we're using the clean channel, then V2B is bypassed and the signal is sent straight to the power
amp. (The power amp consists of the phase inverter, the power tubes, the output transformer, and
the speaker—respectfully.) If we're using the drive channel, then another gain stage (V2B) is
inserted into the chain. This adds more gain and helps push the poweramp into saturation (or
distortion) earlier. Even though V3A and V3B use "preamp" tubes, it's actually considered part of
the poweramp. It even distorts differently than V1 and V2.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we've shown that all the preamp tubes are interconnected in the circuit, and
switching one tube will affect the tone of all channels.</p>
